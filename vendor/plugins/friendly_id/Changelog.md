## 2.3.1 (2010-02-09)

* Fixed stack level too deep error on #strip_diacritics.


## 2.3.0 (2010-02-04)

This is a major update à la "Snow Leopard" that adds no new major features,
but significantly improves the underlying code. Most users should be able to
upgrade with no issues other than new deprecation messages appearing in the
logs.

If, however, you have monkey-patched FriendlyId, or are maintaining your own
fork, then this upgrade may causes issues.

**Changes:**

* Sequence separator can now be configured to something other than "--".
* New option to pass arguments to {FriendlyId::SlugString#approximate_ascii!},
  allowing custom approximations specific to German or Spanish.
* FriendlyId now queries against the cached_slug column, which improves performance.
* {FriendlyId::SlugString} class added, allowing finer-grained control over
  Unicode friendly_id strings.
* {FriendlyId::Configuration} class added, offering more flexible/hackable
  options.
* FriendlyId now raises subclasses of {FriendlyId::SlugGenerationError}
  depending on the error context.
* Simple models now correctly validate friendly_id length.
* Passing block into FriendlyId deprecated in favor of overriding
  the model's `normalize_friendly_id` method.
* Updating only the model's scope now also updates the slug.
* Major refactorings, cleanups and deprecations en route to the 3.0 release.

* Fixed typo in Rake tasks which caused delete_old_slugs to fail. (Diego R.V.)

## 2.2.6 (2009-12-10)

  ActiveRecord has established its connection.
* Fixes for scope feature with Postgres (Ben Woosley)
* Migrated away from Hoe/Newgem for gem management.
* Made tests database-agnostic (Ben Woosley)
